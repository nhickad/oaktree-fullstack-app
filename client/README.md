cd oaktree-fullstack-app

```

## Backend Setup (Flask API)

```bash
cd server


```

## Create virtual environment:

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

```

```

## Option B: Manual install

```bash
python -c "from db import init_db; init_db()"

```

## Option B: Manual install

```

Frontend Setup (Next.js)


## Navigate to the client folder:

cd ../client

```

## Install Node.js dependencies:

npm install

```

## Start the frontend dev server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

## Features

- User Registration & Login with JWT
- Protected routes (backend + frontend)
- CRUD functionality for Inventory Items
- Real-time Feedback via React Toastify
- Error Handling & Validation
- Mobile Responsive UI
- Token invalidation on logout

## Approach

### Backend

- Flask REST API using Blueprints
- JWT used for authentication (generated on login, validated on each protected route)
- SQLite used for data persistence
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Endpoints check for token validity and respond accordingly
- Validation included on fields like price, name, status

### Frontend

- Built with Next.js Pages Router
- Used axios for API interaction and React Toastify for user feedback
- Protected pages with a withAuth HOC to verify token presence and validity
- Form validation handled on the client side
- Layout built using Bootstrap grid and components

## Assumptions

- One user type ‚Äî no role-based access (Admin/User)
- JWT secret is hardcoded in Flask backend (`SECRET_KEY`)
- SQLite database is stored locally as `database.db`
- No image upload feature ‚Äî only URL string accepted for item image
- Token is stored in localStorage (not cookies)
- Toast notifications are used for all success/error events
- User will always be redirected to `/login` when not authenticated
- Project is intended for local development and demonstration purposes

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                  |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------|
| POST   | /register         | Register new user            |
| POST   | /login            | Login & receive JWT          |
| GET    | /protected        | Validate JWT and get user    |
| GET    | /api/items        | Get all items                |
| GET    | /api/items/:id    | Get item by ID               |
| POST   | /api/items        | Create item                  |
| PUT    | /api/items/:id    | Update item by ID            |
| DELETE | /api/items/:id    | Delete item by ID            |
